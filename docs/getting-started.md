# Getting Started

Welcome to the Trinus Automation Demo Agile documentation!

## What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments.

## Key Principles

1. **Customer satisfaction** through early and continuous delivery
2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development
3. **Deliver working software frequently**
4. **Collaboration** between business stakeholders and developers
5. **Build projects around motivated individuals**
6. **Face-to-face communication** is the most efficient method
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress
8. **Sustainable development** pace
9. **Continuous attention** to technical excellence
10. **Simplicity** - the art of maximizing work not done
11. **Self-organizing teams** produce the best results
12. **Regular reflection** on how to become more effective
