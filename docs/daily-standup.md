# Daily Standup

## What is a Daily Standup?

The Daily Standup (also called Daily Scrum) is a short, time-boxed meeting where team members synchronize their work and plan for the next 24 hours. It's a key inspect-and-adapt ceremony in Agile.

## Daily Standup Overview

- **Duration**: 15 minutes (strictly time-boxed)
- **Frequency**: Every working day
- **Time**: Same time each day
- **Participants**: Development Team (required), Scrum Master (facilitator), Product Owner (optional)
- **Format**: Standing up (helps keep it short!)

## The Three Questions

Each team member answers these three questions:

### 1. What did I complete yesterday?
- Share what was accomplished since the last standup
- Focus on work that moves toward the Sprint Goal
- Keep it brief - just the highlights

### 2. What will I work on today?
- Share your plan for the next 24 hours
- Align work with the Sprint Goal
- Make commitments you can keep

### 3. Are there any blockers or impediments?
- Identify obstacles preventing progress
- Don't solve problems in the standup
- Scrum Master takes note to address later

## Best Practices

1. **Be on time**: Respect everyone's schedule
2. **Stay focused**: Keep discussions relevant to the three questions
3. **Be brief**: Each person should speak for 1-2 minutes maximum
4. **Stand up**: Helps maintain energy and keep it short
5. **Face the board**: Reference the task board or sprint backlog
6. **No problem-solving**: Take detailed discussions offline
7. **Everyone participates**: All team members should speak
8. **Same time, same place**: Consistency builds the habit

## Common Formats

### Traditional Format
Each person answers the three questions in turn.

### Walk the Board Format
Go through each item on the board from right to left (done to in-progress to to-do), and team members speak when their work is mentioned.

### Round Robin Format
Pass a "talking token" (ball, mascot, etc.) - only the person holding it can speak.

## Red Flags

Watch out for these warning signs:

- 🚩 **Meeting runs long**: Should never exceed 15 minutes
- 🚩 **Problem-solving discussions**: Take these offline
- 🚩 **Status reports to Scrum Master**: Team members should talk to each other
- 🚩 **Low energy**: People aren't engaged or present
- 🚩 **Team members skip regularly**: Sign of low commitment
- 🚩 **Too much detail**: Getting lost in technical weeds
- 🚩 **Silent members**: Everyone should participate

## Handling Blockers

When blockers are identified:

1. **Acknowledge it**: Make sure everyone heard
2. **Don't solve it now**: The standup is not the place
3. **Park it**: Note it for later discussion
4. **Follow up**: Scrum Master should help resolve after the meeting
5. **Update the team**: Share resolution at the next standup

## Remote Standup Tips

For distributed teams:

- ✅ Use video conferencing
- ✅ Share screens to view the board together
- ✅ Use digital tools (Slack, Teams, Jira)
- ✅ Be mindful of time zones
- ✅ Record standups for those who can't attend
- ✅ Use asynchronous standup tools if needed

## Alternative Approaches

### Asynchronous Standup
Team members post their updates in a chat channel when convenient within a time window.

**Pros:**
- Works well for distributed teams across time zones
- Allows for thoughtful responses
- Creates written record

**Cons:**
- Less interaction and team bonding
- May miss quick clarifications
- Requires discipline to participate

## Sample Standup Update

> **Developer:** "Yesterday, I completed the login API endpoint and wrote unit tests for it. Today, I'm going to integrate it with the frontend login form. No blockers."

> **Designer:** "Yesterday, I finished the mockups for the dashboard and shared them in Figma. Today, I'll work on the mobile responsive views. I'm blocked waiting for feedback on the color palette from the Product Owner."

> **QA Engineer:** "Yesterday, I tested the search functionality and logged three bugs in Jira. Today, I'll verify the fixes and start testing the notification system. No blockers."
