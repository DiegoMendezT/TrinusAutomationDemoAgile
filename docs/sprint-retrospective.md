# Sprint Retrospective

## What is a Sprint Retrospective?

The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting where the team reflects on their process and identifies improvements for the next sprint. It's a dedicated time for the team to inspect itself and create a plan for enhancements.

## Sprint Retrospective Overview

- **Duration**: 1-1.5 hours for a 2-week sprint
- **Timing**: After Sprint Review, before next Sprint Planning
- **Participants**: Scrum Team only (Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner)
- **Format**: Facilitated discussion focused on improvement
- **Outcome**: Action items for process improvement

## The Purpose

The retrospective helps the team answer:

1. **What went well?** - Identify successes to repeat
2. **What didn't go well?** - Recognize issues to address
3. **What can we improve?** - Create actionable changes

## Sprint Retrospective Agenda

### 1. Set the Stage (5 minutes)
- Welcome everyone
- Review retrospective purpose and goals
- Set ground rules (e.g., "Vegas rule" - what's said here stays here)
- Create safe, open environment

### 2. Gather Data (15 minutes)
- Review sprint metrics and data
- Collect team member observations
- Use retrospective activities (see formats below)

### 3. Generate Insights (20 minutes)
- Discuss patterns and themes
- Identify root causes
- Prioritize issues to address

### 4. Decide What to Do (15 minutes)
- Create specific, actionable improvements
- Assign owners to action items
- Set success criteria

### 5. Close the Retrospective (5 minutes)
- Summarize action items
- Appreciate team contributions
- Confirm next steps

## Popular Retrospective Formats

### Start, Stop, Continue
Team members identify:
- **Start**: What should we begin doing?
- **Stop**: What should we stop doing?
- **Continue**: What should we keep doing?

### Mad, Sad, Glad
Team members share:
- **Mad**: What frustrated us?
- **Sad**: What disappointed us?
- **Glad**: What made us happy?

### 4 Ls
Reflect on:
- **Liked**: What did we enjoy?
- **Learned**: What did we discover?
- **Lacked**: What was missing?
- **Longed For**: What did we wish for?

### Sailboat
Visual metaphor:
- **Wind**: What helped us move forward?
- **Anchor**: What held us back?
- **Rocks**: What risks do we face?
- **Island**: What is our goal?

### Timeline
Create a visual timeline of the sprint:
- Mark significant events
- Note emotional reactions
- Identify patterns over time

## Best Practices

1. **Psychological safety**: Create environment where everyone can speak freely
2. **Focus on process**: Discuss how the team works, not individual performance
3. **Be specific**: Use concrete examples, not generalizations
4. **Look forward**: Focus on improvement, not blame
5. **Actionable items**: Create specific tasks with owners
6. **Follow through**: Review previous action items
7. **Vary the format**: Keep retrospectives fresh and engaging
8. **Timebox discussions**: Stay focused and on schedule
9. **Everyone participates**: Hear from all team members
10. **Document outcomes**: Record and share action items

## Ground Rules

Establish these principles:

- 🤝 **Prime Directive**: "Everyone did the best job they could"
- 🔒 **Confidentiality**: What's discussed stays in the room
- 💭 **No blame**: Focus on problems, not people
- 👂 **Active listening**: Really hear what others say
- 🗣️ **Everyone speaks**: All voices are valued
- ⏰ **Time awareness**: Respect the timebox
- 📱 **Present**: No distractions or multitasking

## Sample Action Items

Good action items are **SMART**:
- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**chievable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime-bound

### Examples:

✅ **Good:**
> "John will set up automated deployment to staging by Friday, so we can demo earlier in the sprint."

✅ **Good:**
> "Team will do pairing on complex features starting next sprint. Track in retrospective if quality improves."

✅ **Good:**
> "Sarah will book a conference room with a TV for daily standups starting Monday to improve remote participation."

❌ **Bad:**
> "We need better communication." (Not specific or actionable)

❌ **Bad:**
> "Everyone should write better code." (Vague and blame-oriented)

## Facilitator Role

The Scrum Master typically facilitates and should:

- ✅ Prepare the retrospective format and materials
- ✅ Create a safe environment for honest discussion
- ✅ Keep the meeting on track and on time
- ✅ Ensure everyone participates
- ✅ Help the team dig deeper into issues
- ✅ Guide toward actionable outcomes
- ✅ Document and follow up on action items
- ✅ Remain neutral and not dominate discussion

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Same issues every sprint
**Solution:** Focus on root causes, not symptoms. Try the "5 Whys" technique.

### Challenge: Low participation
**Solution:** Use different formats, do activities in pairs/small groups first, explicitly ask quiet members for input.

### Challenge: Only complaints, no solutions
**Solution:** Redirect to "What can we do about it?" Follow problem statements with action brainstorming.

### Challenge: Finger-pointing and blame
**Solution:** Reinforce ground rules, reframe as system/process issues, intervene if it continues.

### Challenge: No follow-through on action items
**Solution:** Assign clear owners, review previous actions at start of each retro, limit number of action items.

### Challenge: Running over time
**Solution:** Strict timebox adherence, park detailed discussions for later, focus on top 2-3 issues.

## Metrics and Data to Review

Consider reviewing:

- 📊 **Velocity trend**: Story points per sprint
- 🔥 **Burndown chart**: Work remaining over sprint
- 🐛 **Bug metrics**: Defects found/fixed
- ⚡ **Cycle time**: Time from start to done
- 👥 **Team capacity**: Availability vs. planned
- 🎯 **Sprint goal achievement**: Met/not met
- ⏰ **Meeting effectiveness**: Time in meetings
- 😊 **Team happiness**: Mood tracking

## Remote Retrospective Tips

For distributed teams:

- 💻 Use collaborative online tools (Miro, Mural, Retrium)
- 🎥 Keep cameras on for better engagement
- ✍️ Use digital sticky notes for anonymous input
- ⏱️ Give extra time for typing vs. speaking
- 🔄 Rotate facilitator to share responsibility
- 📸 Take screenshots of boards for documentation
- 🎮 Use online games or icebreakers to energize

## Retrospective Anti-Patterns

Avoid these common mistakes:

- ❌ **Skipping retrospectives**: "We're too busy"
- ❌ **Status meeting**: Reporting on work instead of process
- ❌ **Same format every time**: Leads to boredom
- ❌ **No action items**: Just talking, no follow-through
- ❌ **Too many action items**: Can't accomplish them all
- ❌ **Ignoring previous actions**: Not reviewing past commitments
- ❌ **Management present**: Reduces psychological safety
- ❌ **Blame culture**: Pointing fingers instead of fixing systems

## Continuous Improvement Cycle

```
Retrospective → Action Items → Implementation → Next Retrospective
     ↑                                                    ↓
     ←-------- Review Results and Adjust ←---------------
```

The retrospective is part of a continuous improvement loop:

1. Identify improvement opportunities
2. Create action items
3. Implement changes during sprint
4. Observe results
5. Review in next retrospective
6. Adjust and continue

## Success Indicators

A successful retrospective includes:

- ✅ Everyone participates and shares openly
- ✅ Team identifies both successes and challenges
- ✅ Concrete action items are created
- ✅ Previous action items are reviewed
- ✅ Team feels heard and valued
- ✅ Positive energy and forward focus
- ✅ Commitment to improvement
- ✅ Meeting stays within timebox
