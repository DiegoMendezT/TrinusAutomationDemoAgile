# Sprint Planning

## What is Sprint Planning?

Sprint Planning is a collaborative event where the team defines what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how that work will be achieved. It marks the beginning of each sprint.

## Sprint Planning Overview

- **Duration**: Typically 2-4 hours for a 2-week sprint
- **Participants**: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team
- **Outcome**: Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog

## The Two Main Questions

### 1. What can be done in this sprint?

The Product Owner presents the top priority items from the Product Backlog. The Development Team discusses what they can commit to completing during the sprint, considering:

- Team capacity
- Team velocity from previous sprints
- Technical dependencies
- Team member availability

### 2. How will the chosen work get done?

The Development Team creates a plan for delivering the selected Product Backlog items. This involves:

- Breaking down user stories into tasks
- Estimating task effort
- Identifying dependencies
- Assigning initial ownership (if applicable)

## Sprint Planning Agenda

1. **Review Sprint Goal** (15 min)
   - Product Owner presents the objective for the sprint

2. **Review Product Backlog** (30 min)
   - Product Owner explains top priority items
   - Team asks clarifying questions

3. **Determine Sprint Capacity** (15 min)
   - Calculate available team hours
   - Account for holidays, meetings, and other commitments

4. **Select Sprint Backlog Items** (45 min)
   - Team commits to items they can complete
   - Ensure items align with the Sprint Goal

5. **Create Task Breakdown** (60 min)
   - Break stories into actionable tasks
   - Identify dependencies and risks

6. **Confirm Sprint Goal** (15 min)
   - Finalize and communicate the sprint commitment

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Establish clear criteria for when work is considered complete:

- Code written and reviewed
- Unit tests written and passing
- Integration tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Code merged to main branch
- Deployed to staging environment
- Acceptance criteria met
- Product Owner approval received

## Best Practices

1. **Come prepared**: Product Owner should have a refined backlog
2. **Timebox the meeting**: Don't let planning drag on too long
3. **Focus on the goal**: All selected work should support the Sprint Goal
4. **Be realistic**: Don't overcommit - consider team velocity
5. **Clarify requirements**: Ensure everyone understands the work
6. **Identify blockers early**: Address potential issues upfront
7. **Collaborative estimation**: Get input from the whole team
8. **Document decisions**: Record the Sprint Goal and committed items

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Planning without a refined backlog
- ❌ Overcommitting to too much work
- ❌ Skipping the "how" discussion
- ❌ Not considering team capacity
- ❌ Ignoring technical debt
- ❌ Lack of Product Owner involvement

## Tools and Techniques

- **Planning Poker**: Team-based estimation technique
- **Story Points**: Relative sizing of work items
- **Velocity Charts**: Historical data for capacity planning
- **Burndown Charts**: Track progress during the sprint
- **Task Boards**: Visualize work and workflow
