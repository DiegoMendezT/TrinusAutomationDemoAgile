# User Stories

## What is a User Story?

A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.

## User Story Format

The most common format for user stories is:

```
As a [type of user],
I want [an action or feature],
So that [benefit or value].
```

## Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Site
```
As a customer,
I want to add items to my shopping cart,
So that I can purchase multiple items at once.
```

### Example 2: Mobile App
```
As a mobile app user,
I want to receive push notifications,
So that I can stay updated on important events.
```

### Example 3: Admin Dashboard
```
As an administrator,
I want to view user activity reports,
So that I can monitor system usage and identify trends.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Each user story should have clear acceptance criteria that define when the story is "done":

- **Given** [context or precondition]
- **When** [action or event]
- **Then** [expected outcome]

### Example Acceptance Criteria:
```
Given I am on the product page,
When I click the "Add to Cart" button,
Then the item should be added to my cart and the cart count should increase by 1.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple**: User stories should be concise and easy to understand
2. **Focus on value**: Always emphasize the benefit to the user
3. **Independent**: Stories should be self-contained when possible
4. **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed with the team
5. **Valuable**: Each story should deliver value to the end user
6. **Estimable**: The team should be able to estimate effort
7. **Small**: Stories should be completable within a single sprint
8. **Testable**: Clear criteria for testing completion

## Story Points

Story points are a unit of measure for expressing the overall effort required to implement a user story. They consider:

- **Complexity**: How difficult is the work?
- **Uncertainty**: How much is unknown?
- **Effort**: How much work is involved?

Common scales: Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) or T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL)
