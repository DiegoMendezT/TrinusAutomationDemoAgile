## Required Scrum Meetings (Events)

These are the official Scrum ceremonies. For the Trinus.com Automation Demo, only Sprint Planning and Sprint Retrospective were formally held and documented for each sprint. All other ceremonies were symbolically acknowledged in the process and outcomes.

- **Sprint Planning:** Held and documented. Defined Sprint Goal, selected and estimated work, clarified Acceptance Criteria.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Held and documented. Inspected and adapted the process, identified improvements.
- **Sprint (Iteration):** Each sprint was time-boxed and documented.
- **Daily Scrum (Standup):** Symbolically acknowledged, not formally documented.
- **Sprint Review:** Symbolically acknowledged, outcomes included in planning/retro.

## Optional/Recommended Agile Meetings

These meetings are common in Agile teams but are not required by Scrum. In the Trinus Demo, they were symbolically acknowledged and their outcomes were integrated into the main ceremonies or documentation as appropriate.

- **Backlog Refinement (Grooming):** Symbolic; handled in planning.
- **Product Demo:** Symbolic; outcomes included in review/retro.
- **Technical Spike/POC Review:** Symbolic; discussed in planning/retro.
- **Release Planning:** Symbolic; managed via sprint planning.
- **Roadmap/Strategy Session:** Symbolic; handled in initial planning.
- **Stakeholder Alignment Meeting:** Symbolic; feedback captured in review/retro.
- **Team Health Check/Working Agreement Review:** Symbolic; discussed in retro.

## Notes & Compliance
- For the Trinus.com Automation Demo, only Sprint Planning and Sprint Retrospective were formally included in the demo package to keep the process lean and focused.
- All other meetings were acknowledged symbolically and their outcomes were integrated into the main ceremonies or documentation.
- This approach ensures compliance with Agile/Scrum principles while optimizing for demo clarity and traceability.
