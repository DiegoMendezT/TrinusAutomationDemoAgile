# Trinus Demo — Sprint 1 Triage Meeting

**Date:** 2025-12-16  
**Sprint:** 1

## Agile Triage Overview
The Product Backlog for Sprint 1 was reviewed and prioritized by the full Symbolic Agile-Team, using taskprioritizer.py logic (ROI, risk, learning, complexity). All User Stories selected are mapped to the Trinus.com Automation Epic ([TRINUS-E1]) and its Feature Blocks, ensuring traceability and compliance.

### User Stories Triaged (Sprint 1)
- **US-NAV-1.1:** Automate login and authentication flows for Trinus.com using Selenium.
- **US-NAV-1.2:** Automate main menu and subpage navigation for all critical user journeys.
- **US-NAV-1.3:** Validate navigation for all top-level and submenu pages, capturing evidence for each.
- **US-NAV-1.4:** Ensure navigation tests are reproducible and evidence-driven for auditability.
- **US-NAV-1.5 (Spike):** Investigate Selenium edge cases and propose POC for automating complex navigation scenarios.
- **US-EVD-2.1:** Implement per-run evidence folders and retention logic for all test executions.
- **US-EVD-2.2:** Display evidence (screenshots, logs) in the UI for demo-readiness and director review.

### Triage Outcomes
- High-value, low-risk User Stories prioritized for MVP delivery.
- Technical spikes and impediments documented for review.
- All priorities and outcomes are traceable to Epic [TRINUS-E1] and its acceptance criteria ([AC-1] to [AC-5]).

### Lessons & Adjustments
- Triage logic enabled focus on high-value, low-risk work and improved clarity in backlog item descriptions.
- Early alignment and evidence standards built trust and transparency, supporting empiricism and inspect/adapt cycles.

### Next Steps
- Finalize Sprint Backlog for Planning.
- Confirm acceptance criteria and Definition of Done (DoD) for selected User Stories.
