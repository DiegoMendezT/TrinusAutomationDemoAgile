# Trinus Demo — Sprint 1 Retrospective (IT Tech Director Edition)

**Date:** 2025-12-16  
**Sprint:** 1

## Technical Outcomes
- MVP delivered: Selenium-based, reproducible test suite with evidence as Sprint Goal (US-NAV-1.1 to US-NAV-1.4, US-EVD-2.1)
- Navigation automation for login, main menu, and subpages completed (US-NAV-1.1, US-NAV-1.2)
- Evidence management: per-run folders and retention logic implemented (US-EVD-2.1)
- Technical spike: Selenium edge cases investigated, POC proposed (US-NAV-1.5)
- All priorities and risk decisions set using taskprioritizer.py (ROI, risk, learning, complexity)

## Lessons & Adjustments
- Early alignment and evidence standards built trust and transparency, supporting empiricism and inspect/adapt cycles
- Clear roles and acceptance criteria accelerated delivery and team consensus
- Minor bug in taskprioritizer.py reflection logic noted (scheduled for fix)
- Evidence retention policy clarified for next sprint

## Next Steps (Sprint 2 Preparation)
- Address minor bug in prioritizer logic (see US-NAV-1.5)
- Continue evidence clarity and retention improvements (US-EVD-2.2 planned for Sprint 2)
- Prepare for adaptation and backlog refinement in Sprint 2, focusing on navigation test cases and enhanced evidence display
