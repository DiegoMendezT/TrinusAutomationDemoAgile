## Executive Summary
Sprint 4 focused on scaling automation, cross-functional value, and expanding coverage to new navigation and API challenges. The team delivered reproducible navigation tests, polished UI and evidence for executive review, and advanced API validation and mocking. This Retrospective captures lessons learned, improvements, and traceability to the Epic and Agile Journey.

---

## What Went Well
- **Navigation Reproducibility:** Delivered reproducible, evidence-driven navigation tests (US-NAV-1.4)
- **UI & Evidence Polish:** Enhanced UI and evidence display for executive and cross-team review (US-DEMO-4.2)
- **API Validation:** Automated API endpoint validation for core services (US-API-5.1)
- **API Mocking POC:** Researched and proposed POC for simulating unavailable endpoints (US-API-5.4)
- **Cross-Team Engagement:** Increased collaboration and feedback from multiple teams

---

## What Could Be Improved
- **Evidence Unification:** Continue to unify evidence display across all test types (future US-DEMO-4.3)
- **API Automation Depth:** Expand API automation to cover more edge cases and integrations
- **Stakeholder Demo Impact:** Further polish demo artifacts for broader stakeholder impact
- **Documentation:** Improve documentation of technical spikes and lessons for future sprints

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Scaling Requires Adaptability:** Adapting automation standards for new domains is key to cross-functional success
- **Collaboration Drives Value:** Engaging more teams increased feedback and improved outcomes
- **Continuous Improvement:** Daily standups and open retrospectives supported rapid learning and course correction
- **Traceability is Essential:** Mapping all work to Epic, Blocks, and User Stories enabled transparent progress tracking

---

## Action Items for Next Sprint
- Unify evidence display for all test types (US-DEMO-4.3)
- Expand API automation coverage and integrations
- Further polish demo artifacts for stakeholder review
- Document technical spikes and lessons learned for future reference
