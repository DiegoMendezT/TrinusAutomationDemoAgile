## Sprint 4 Goals & Context
- **Scaling Automation:** Apply automation standards to new navigation and business challenges (US-NAV-1.4)
- **UI & Evidence Polish:** Enhance UI and evidence display for executive and cross-team review (US-DEMO-4.2)
- **API Validation:** Automate API endpoint validation for core services (US-API-5.1)
- **API Mocking (Spike):** Research and propose POC for simulating unavailable endpoints during test runs (US-API-5.4)
- **Continuous Improvement:** Integrate lessons from previous sprints and foster cross-team collaboration
