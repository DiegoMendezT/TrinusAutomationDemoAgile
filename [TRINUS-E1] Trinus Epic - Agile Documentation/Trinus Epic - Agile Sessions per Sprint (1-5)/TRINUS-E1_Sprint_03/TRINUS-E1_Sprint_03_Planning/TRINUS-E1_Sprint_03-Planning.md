## Jira-Style Traceability & Mapping
This Sprint Planning document is fully traceable to the Trinus.com Automation Epic (TRINUS-E1). All User Stories (US) are mapped to their respective Feature Blocks and Epic Acceptance Criteria (AC). This ensures every increment is director/stakeholder-ready and audit-compliant.

### Epic Summary
**Epic Name:** Trinus.com Automation Epic  
**Epic Key:** TRINUS-E1  
**Description:** Deliver a fully automated, evidence-driven QA suite for Trinus.com, incrementally through five Scrum sprints, covering all critical navigation, evidence, prioritization, demo, and impediment-handling workflows.  
**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- [AC-1] All critical Trinus.com workflows (login, navigation, subpages) are automated and demo-ready.
- [AC-2] Evidence is captured, organized, and displayed for every test run, with retention and auditability.
- [AC-3] Backlog, prioritization, and traceability are maintained from Epic to delivered increments using taskprioritizer.py and Jira mapping.
- [AC-4] Stakeholder-ready demos and UI polish are delivered for every increment, with video artifacts and executive review.
- [AC-5] All impediments (e.g., automation guards) are documented, with technical spikes and POCs proposed and reviewed.

### Sprint 3: Epic → Block → User Story Mapping
| User Story      | Block   | Epic AC Trace | Description |
|-----------------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| US-NAV-1.3      | NAV-1   | AC-1, AC-2, AC-4 | Validate navigation for all top-level and submenu pages, capturing evidence for each |
| US-DEMO-4.1     | DEMO-4  | AC-4, AC-2    | Deliver a stakeholder-ready UI and demo walkthrough for each increment, including video artifacts |
| US-PRI-3.3      | PRI-3   | AC-3, AC-4    | Ensure all priorities are set and traceable to Epic AC |
| US-DEMO-4.4 (Spike) | DEMO-4 | AC-4, AC-2 | Research demo automation tools and propose POC for automating stakeholder demo creation and video artifact generation |

## Executive Summary
Sprint 3 focuses on finalizing demo polish, unifying evidence, and delivering a stakeholder-ready UI. The team will address last-mile fixes, rehearse the demo, and prepare for Sprint Review, ensuring all increments are visible, understandable, and valuable to stakeholders. All User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and priorities are traceable to the Epic, Blocks, and Agile Journey.
