# [TRINUS-E1] Sprint 2 Triage & Planning

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Ceremony:** Sprint 2 Triage & Planning
**Epic Reference:** [TRINUS-E1] Trinus.com Automation Epic
**Journey Reference:** Agile_Journey_Rev1.md

---

## Executive Summary
Sprint 2 Triage builds directly on the validated outcomes and lessons from Sprint 1 (see Sprint 1 Retrospective). The team adapts to new constraints and opportunities, prioritizing User Stories that deliver immediate stakeholder value and support empirical, evidence-driven improvement. All priorities, Acceptance Criteria, and rationale are traceable to the Epic and Agile Journey.

---

## Sprint 2 Goals & Context
- **Adaptation:** Respond to Sprint 1 lessons and real-world constraints (e.g., Job Filter module blocked).
- **Value Delivery:** Focus on navigation, evidence display, and traceability for demo-readiness.
- **Empiricism:** Prioritize based on evidence, feedback, and business impact.

---

## User Stories Selected for Sprint 2
From Epic [TRINUS-E1]:

1. **US-NAV-1.2:** Automate main menu and subpage navigation for all critical user journeys.
2. **US-EVD-2.2:** Display evidence (screenshots, logs) in the UI for demo-readiness and director review.
3. **US-PRI-3.2:** Maintain full traceability from Epic/Block/US to Sprint and demo artifacts.
4. **US-EVD-2.4 (Spike):** Research best practices for evidence retention and propose POC for integrating evidence with external audit systems.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC) & Prioritization

### US-NAV-1.2
- **AC:** All main menu and subpage navigation flows are automated and reproducible.
- **Priority:** High (enables broader test coverage and demo-readiness)
- **Rationale:** Builds on Sprint 1 navigation foundation; addresses stakeholder need for comprehensive coverage.

### US-EVD-2.2
- **AC:** Evidence (screenshots, logs) is displayed in the UI, accessible for director review.
- **Priority:** High (critical for demo and executive validation)
- **Rationale:** Directly supports demo-readiness and transparency.

### US-PRI-3.2
- **AC:** All work is traceable from Epic/Block/US to Sprint and demo artifacts using taskprioritizer.py.
- **Priority:** Medium (supports auditability and process improvement)
- **Rationale:** Ensures compliance and enables future scaling.

### US-EVD-2.4 (Spike)
- **AC:** Research completed; POC proposed for evidence retention and external audit integration.
- **Priority:** Medium (future-proofing evidence management)
- **Rationale:** Addresses long-term audit and retention needs.

---

## Team Decisions & Working Agreements
- **Empirical Adaptation:** Team agrees to reprioritize if new constraints or opportunities arise during the sprint.
- **Transparency:** All decisions and outcomes will be documented and traceable to the Epic and Journey.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Lessons from Sprint 1 will inform daily standups and course corrections.

## Traceability Matrix
| User Story      | Epic Block | Acceptance Criteria | Priority | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------------|----------|-----------|
| US-NAV-1.2      | NAV-1     | Automated navigation flows | High     | Demo coverage |
| US-EVD-2.2      | EVD-2     | Evidence displayed in UI   | High     | Stakeholder review |
| US-PRI-3.2      | PRI-3     | Full traceability          | Medium   | Auditability |
| US-EVD-2.4      | EVD-2     | Evidence retention POC     | Medium   | Future-proofing |

---

## Next Steps
- Begin Sprint 2 execution with daily standups focused on adaptation and transparency.
- Document all outcomes and lessons for the Sprint 2 Retrospective.
- Ensure all delivered increments are demo-ready and traceable to the Epic.
