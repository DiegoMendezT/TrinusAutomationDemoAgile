# [TRINUS-E1] Sprint 5 Triage & Planning

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Ceremony:** Sprint 5 Triage & Planning
**Epic Reference:** [TRINUS-E1] Trinus.com Automation Epic
**Journey Reference:** Agile_Journey_Rev1.md
**Previous Retro Reference:** TRINUS_SPRINT4_RETRO.md

---

## Executive Summary
Sprint 5 Triage builds on the scaling and cross-functional value achieved in Sprint 4. The team now focuses on continuous improvement, technical spikes, and overcoming automation safeguards in protected modules. All priorities, Acceptance Criteria, and rationale are traceable to the Epic and Agile Journey.

---

## Sprint 5 Goals & Context
- **Impediment Handling:** Document all automation guards and impediments for protected modules (US-IMP-8.1)
- **Technical Spikes:** Propose and document technical spikes and POCs for bypassing automation guards (US-IMP-8.2)
- **Actionable Solutions:** Create actionable items and possible solutions from the Spike, including a possible POC for bypassing the guard (US-IMP-8.3)
- **Future-Proofing:** Research automation guard bypass strategies and propose POC for future-proofing automation (US-IMP-8.4)
- **Continuous Improvement:** Integrate lessons from previous sprints and document all technical learnings

---

## User Stories Selected for Sprint 5
From Epic [TRINUS-E1]:

1. **US-IMP-8.1:** Document all automation guards and impediments for protected modules (e.g., Jobs module), including failed attempts and lessons learned.
2. **US-IMP-8.2:** Propose and document technical spikes and POCs for bypassing automation guards, with actionable recommendations for future sprints.
3. **US-IMP-8.3:** Create actionable items and possible solutions from the Spike, including a possible POC for bypassing the guard and the required stack.
4. **US-IMP-8.4 (Spike):** Research automation guard bypass strategies and propose POC for future-proofing automation against new impediments.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC) & Prioritization

### US-IMP-8.1
- **AC:** All automation guards and impediments documented for protected modules; failed attempts and lessons learned included.
- **Priority:** High (critical for continuous improvement and future automation)
- **Rationale:** Ensures transparency and learning from challenges.

### US-IMP-8.2
- **AC:** Technical spikes and POCs for bypassing automation guards proposed and documented; actionable recommendations provided.
- **Priority:** High (enables future automation and innovation)
- **Rationale:** Supports empirical process and technical advancement.

### US-IMP-8.3
- **AC:** Actionable items and possible solutions created from the Spike, including a possible POC for bypassing the guard and the required stack.
- **Priority:** Medium (drives implementation and future-proofing)
- **Rationale:** Translates technical research into practical solutions.

### US-IMP-8.4 (Spike)
- **AC:** Research completed; POC proposed for future-proofing automation against new impediments.
- **Priority:** Medium (supports long-term resilience)
- **Rationale:** Ensures automation remains robust and adaptable.

---

## Team Decisions & Working Agreements
- **Continuous Improvement:** Team agrees to prioritize learning from impediments and technical spikes.
- **Transparency:** All decisions and outcomes will be documented and traceable to the Epic and Journey.
- **Collaboration:** Lessons learned will be shared across teams for broader impact.
