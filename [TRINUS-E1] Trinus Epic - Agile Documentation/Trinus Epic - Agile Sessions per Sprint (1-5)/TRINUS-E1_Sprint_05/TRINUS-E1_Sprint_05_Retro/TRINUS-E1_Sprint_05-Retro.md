## Executive Summary
Sprint 5 focused on overcoming automation safeguards in protected modules, documenting impediments, and proposing technical spikes and POCs. The team prioritized continuous improvement, transparency, and collaboration, ensuring all outcomes are traceable to the Epic and Agile Journey.

---

## What Went Well
- Comprehensive documentation of automation guards and impediments (US-IMP-8.1)
- Actionable technical spikes and POCs proposed for bypassing automation guards (US-IMP-8.2)
- Creation of actionable solutions and a POC for future-proofing automation (US-IMP-8.3, US-IMP-8.4)
- Team collaboration and knowledge sharing across roles
- All deliverables traceable to Epic and Journey

---

## What Could Be Improved
- Earlier identification of automation safeguards to reduce delays
- More frequent cross-team reviews to surface impediments sooner
- Enhanced documentation templates for technical spikes and lessons learned

---

## Lessons Learned
- Automation safeguards are best addressed through early documentation and technical spikes
- Collaboration between Automation Engineer, Architect, and QA Director accelerates problem-solving
- Continuous improvement is driven by transparent sharing of failures and solutions

---

## Action Items
- Refine documentation templates for impediments and technical spikes
- Schedule regular cross-team reviews for early impediment detection
- Share lessons learned and POCs with broader engineering and QA teams
