# [TRINUS-E1] Sprint 5 Planning

## Voices Present
The following Agile roles participated in Sprint 5 Planning, ensuring all perspectives and responsibilities were represented:
- Product Owner (Stakeholder)
- Scrum Master (Facilitator)
- Quality Assurance Director (Director)
- Automation Engineer (Engineer)
- Developer (Engineer)
- Architect (Engineer)
- User Acceptance Tester (Stakeholder)
- Machine Learning Lead (Engineer)
- Security Lead (Director)
- Diego Alejandro (Project Lead, Organic Voice)

## Impediments & Adaptations
Sprint 5 centers on overcoming automation guards and impediments, specifically in the Job module. The team will document all protections, attempted solutions, and lessons learned, transforming obstacles into a playbook for future innovation. Adaptations will be made as new technical challenges arise, with technical spikes and POCs prioritized for empirical learning and continuous improvement.

## Sprint 5 Reflection & Lessons Learned
- Continuous improvement is driven by learning from impediments, not just fixing issues.
- Documenting safeguards and attempted solutions creates a resource for future technical spikes and innovation.
- Empirical process and transparency are reinforced by sharing lessons and actionable items.
- The team’s resilience and adaptability are key to overcoming complex automation challenges.

## Jira-Style Traceability & Mapping
This Sprint Planning document is fully traceable to the Trinus.com Automation Epic (TRINUS-E1). All User Stories (US) are mapped to their respective Feature Blocks and Epic Acceptance Criteria (AC). This ensures every increment is director/stakeholder-ready and audit-compliant.

### Epic Summary
**Epic Name:** Trinus.com Automation Epic  
**Epic Key:** TRINUS-E1  
**Description:** Deliver a fully automated, evidence-driven QA suite for Trinus.com, incrementally through five Scrum sprints, covering all critical navigation, evidence, prioritization, demo, and impediment-handling workflows.  
**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- [AC-1] All critical Trinus.com workflows (login, navigation, subpages) are automated and demo-ready.
- [AC-2] Evidence is captured, organized, and displayed for every test run, with retention and auditability.
- [AC-3] Backlog, prioritization, and traceability are maintained from Epic to delivered increments using taskprioritizer.py and Jira mapping.
- [AC-4] Stakeholder-ready demos and UI polish are delivered for every increment, with video artifacts and executive review.
- [AC-5] All impediments (e.g., automation guards) are documented, with technical spikes and POCs proposed and reviewed.

### Sprint 5: Epic → Block → User Story Mapping
| User Story      | Block   | Epic AC Trace | Description |
|-----------------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| US-IMP-8.1      | IMP-8   | AC-5, AC-3, AC-4 | Document all automation guards and impediments for protected modules (e.g., Jobs module), including failed attempts and lessons learned |
| US-IMP-8.2      | IMP-8   | AC-5, AC-3, AC-4 | Propose and document technical spikes and POCs for bypassing automation guards, with actionable recommendations for future sprints |
| US-IMP-8.3      | IMP-8   | AC-5, AC-3, AC-4 | Create actionable items and possible solutions from the Spike, including a possible POC for bypassing the guard and the required stack |
| US-IMP-8.4      | IMP-8   | AC-5, AC-3, AC-4 | (Spike) Research automation guard bypass strategies and propose POC for future-proofing automation against new impediments |

## Executive Summary
Sprint 5 Planning is focused on continuous improvement and overcoming automation impediments, particularly in the Job module. The team will document all protections, attempted solutions, and lessons learned, transforming obstacles into a playbook for future innovation. All User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and priorities are traceable to the Epic (TRINUS-E1), Feature Blocks, and Agile Journey. This document sets the plan for execution, team agreements, and expected outcomes for Sprint 5. All User Stories were created, refined, and prioritized in this session, with explicit mapping to Epic and Block.

## Sprint 5 Goals & Deliverables
- Document all automation guards and impediments for protected modules (e.g., Jobs module) (**US-IMP-8.1**)
- Propose and document technical spikes and POCs for bypassing automation guards (**US-IMP-8.2**)
- Create actionable items and possible solutions from the Spike, including a possible POC for bypassing the guard and the required stack (**US-IMP-8.3**)
- Research automation guard bypass strategies and propose POC for future-proofing automation against new impediments (**US-IMP-8.4**)
